  ### Arrows
]
.right-column[

# Arrow functions

Arrow functions are anonymous functions that lexically bind `this` automatically.  They also have an interesting notation which allows you to throw away most of the code.

If an arrow takes exactly one argument, you may discard the parentheses around the argument.

If there is only one statement in an arrow, you may discard the block *and* the `return`.

ES6:
```javascript
[1,2,3,4,5].map(x => x*2);
```

ES5:
```javascript
[1,2,3,4,5].map( function(x) { return x*2; } );
```

# What makes this hard?

Lots of the problems you see in earlier module systems, such as `tinyloader`s, `angular 1`, `requirejs`, `amd`, `commonjs`, and `npm commonjs` have to do with their only being designed to handle one build target (frontend, backend, custom module, etc.)

The emergence of `bower` and `systemjs` was too late; instead a second layer of packagers, starting with `browserify` and moving on to `webpack`, `rollup`, and so forth, performed a large physical inclusion with a calling convention to hard-rig portable modules.

They all sucked, and were terrible.

The other stuff is about how the packaging works.  `import/export` doesn't care.

`import/export` is about how the code interacts with other code.  And then, it can be compiled down to `commonjs` or whatever, that `webpack` and `browserify` like, or consumed directly from `rollup` or `systemjs`.

The difference is that `import/export` is defined at the level of a language feature, so more modern tools that are legitimately aware of it, like `rollup`, can look at what's being used, and discard the rest (in a process called `tree shaking`,) which dramatically reduces package sizes.

`webpack` and `browserify` have sort of after-the-fact tree shaking, but since `commonjs` is just a set of assumptions, the environment doesn't have as strong guarantees, and can't make nearly as many exclusions.

# What are some downsides?

  - Babel - heavy; slow shims; slow builds; plugins; testing

  - The build organization - separate; transform; exclude

  - New thinking - learn, adapt

  - Old code needs vetting - `eval`, `use strict`, once-over

  - Angular 1 modules

  - Code style transition
    - Changing approaches you're used to is hard
    - Loops to `.map`, `.filter`, `.reduce`, etc
    - Actual classes vs what we used to call classes
