# Destructuring

Destructuring assignment (called `pattern matching` in some languages) is a much easier way to get values out of structures, with less boilerplate.

You may also destructure deep datastructures.

```javascript

  name: {
    first  : 'Bob',
    last   : 'Dobbs'
  },
  job: {
    title  : 'Subgenius',

};
```

```javascript
function GetTitleLine(personData) {
  { name: { first, last }, job: { title } } = personData;
  return first + ' ' + last + "(" + title + ")";
}

If an arrow has exactly one statement, you may write it as an expression, instead.  This means no `{ }` block, and no need for a `return`.

The problem is that what's being bound in that function is the actual variable, rather than the value.  So, as the for loop updates the value, the functions just check the variable, and get the new value.

This can cause weird bugs, especially around shadowing ([this was in a PR here the other day](https://github.com/HoneyBook/HoneybookPaymentsDev/pull/437), and ***does happen semi-frequently*** in the real world.)

# Let

There is almost no good reason to use `var` anymore.

If it's constant (it usually is,) use `const`.

Otherwise, please use `let`.  It prevents problems.

# Template String Literals

We now have a notation for inlining.  Backticks make a "template string."  Within a template string, expressions like `${foo}` are evaluated ***at assignment time***.

```javascript
var whom = "George",
    what = \`I had lunch with ${whom}.\`;
```

These interpolations need not be other variables, or literals; they may be any expression.

```javascript
const seq  = ['bob', 'linda', 'bill', 'mayhem'],
      text = \`We invited: ${ seq.join(', ') }!\`;
```

# Help us better re-use code

Re-use is a very big deal.

- (huge stupid list of examples)
- It's probably on all of our minds

The earlier you tackle the mechanics of ***how*** re-use works, the easier it is in the long term.

This is important because re-use is <span class="red">hard</span>.

# What makes this hard?

Lots of the problems you see in earlier module systems, such as `tinyloader`s, `angular 1`, `requirejs`, `amd`, `commonjs`, and `npm commonjs` have to do with their only being designed to handle one build target (frontend, backend, custom module, etc.)

The emergence of `bower` and `systemjs` was too late; instead a second layer of packagers, starting with `browserify` and moving on to `webpack`, `rollup`, and so forth, performed a large physical inclusion with a calling convention to hard-rig portable modules.

They all sucked, and were terrible.

The other stuff is about how the packaging works.  `import/export` doesn't care.

`import/export` is about how the code interacts with other code.  And then, it can be compiled down to `commonjs` or whatever, that `webpack` and `browserify` like, or consumed directly from `rollup` or `systemjs`.

The difference is that `import/export` is defined at the level of a language feature, so more modern tools that are legitimately aware of it, like `rollup`, can look at what's being used, and discard the rest (in a process called `tree shaking`,) which dramatically reduces package sizes.

`webpack` and `browserify` have sort of after-the-fact tree shaking, but since `commonjs` is just a set of assumptions, the environment doesn't have as strong guarantees, and can't make nearly as many exclusions.

# What are some downsides?

  - Babel - heavy; slow shims; slow builds; plugins; testing

  - The build organization - separate; transform; exclude

  - New thinking - learn, adapt

  - Old code needs vetting
    - Removed ES3 things (like `with`)
    - `eval()` gone (for the best)
    - Everything is in `use strict` now
    - Certain extremely weird code is no longer legal
    - Extreme edge cases
