# Help us do work faster

Some of the features in ES6 can have a surprisingly dramatic impact on productivity.

Template string literals, arrow functions, destructuring assignment, the spread operator, block scoping through `let`, `import`/`export`, real
inheritance, `get`ters and `set`ters, `promise`s, default values, and so on can have enormous impacts on productivity.

Many classes of code that are common online can see 50-75% reductions in the amount of work needed to implement something.

Lots of things have been added to `ES6` that make it easier to find problems.

`const`, `let`, lexical `this` with arrows, typed `Array`s, pseudotype `class`es (no more `\_\_prototype\_\_`!,) default values (especially around `falsey` defaults,)

  - New thinking - learn, adapt

  - Old code needs vetting
    - Removed ES3 things (like `with`)
    - `eval()` gone (for the best)
    - Everything is in `use strict` now
    - Certain extremely weird code is no longer legal
    - Extreme edge cases
      - `Number` accepts octal literals now
      - Missing time zone interpretation changed
